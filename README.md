# Custom Shirt Project - AI

Website: https://tangerine-faloodeh-8a8eab.netlify.app/

Threejs project where I used 3D Shirt model with tools to customize it.

This project was inspired by JSmastery.

1. Users can change the color to whatever they want.

2. Image can be uploaded from your PC, and used as a logo or as a full print on the shirt.

3. The most interesting part is that users can ask AI to create image for their shirt, by giving instructions on what they want to be on the image. This feature was implemented by using openai library and DALL.E.

# Deployment

1. Server: Render.com
2. Client: Netlify.com
